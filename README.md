## Note-Taker
# Challenge #11 - Week 11:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
For an individual who is a small business owner, this application which takes advantage of NodeJS and Express, enables its user to write and save notes quickly! Allowing the user to organise themselves and keep track of tasks throughout the day.


### Files modified
Primarily this application required me to modify server.js and install express.


### Challenges
The main challenge for me throughout the making of this application was sorting out and ensuring the accuracy of the POST and GET methods. I had struggled to ensure the save button worked appropriately. Additionally with the POST method I had struggled to ensure that the db.json was populated appropriately. However, I had overcome these challenge through constant trial and error.


# Installation
This application will require the user use the command npm install, having access to the NodeJs and ExpressJs.


# Usage
As stated within the project description, the usage for this application is to enable a small business owner to write and save their notes of any kind! Enabling the individual to organise their thought and keep track of tasks they would need to complete.
